# Description
This an application what I wanted for a long time but was not able to find it on internet. I do screenshot images
from instagram as they don't let us save any image. Then I had to crop the images. When its a lots of image to crop
I started to looking for a solution to do it automatically. 
As I am a programmer, I take it as a side chalende to develop my own algorithm to do it by myself without using any 
third party libray.

This read me file will be continously update as the project develops.
